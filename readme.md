# Cypress Practice

# To Get Started
- Install `npm install cypress --save-dev`

# Test Runner Component
- Open Cyress with `npx cypress open`. Cypress directory is provided by the command. Test runner is also opened with the command.
- To run test cases, double click on a test file. A web tab will open executing all of the step in that particular test case. 

# Writing Test Case in Cypress
- Test Suite & Test Case Structure in Crypress(Mocha)
```js
describe("Test Suite", function(){
    // in each test suite, we can define multiple test cases using it() function
    it('test case 1', function(){
        // steps
    })

    it('test case 2', function(){
        // steps
    })
})
```
- Remove test files provided by Cypress within `integration/examples` before creating own test cases. Create `firsttest.js` file.
```js
// sample test
describe("First Test", () => {
    it("doesn't do much", () => {
        expect(true).to.equal(true)
    })
})
```

# How to Run Crypress Tests in Test Runner in Terminal
- Cypress supports the electron browser. Runs Electron by default. Can switch between Google Chrome and Electron in the test runner
- To run ALL the test under examples directory, `npx cypress run` in the terminal. Running `npx cypress run --headed` will run in the browser
- To run a SINGLE test, `npx cypress run  -spec "cypress/integration/examples/test_file.js"`
- To switch to Chrome from terminal, run the command, `npx cypress run --browser chrome`
